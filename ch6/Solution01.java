	 * As there are 20 bottles, we can number them from 1 to 20.
	 * 
	 * Then we take 1 pill from No.1 , 2 pills from No.2 , ... , 20 pills from No.20
	 * 
	 * If all the pills were 1.0 gram, then the total weight of all pills took out is 
	 * (1+2+ ... + 20) = (1+20)*20/2=210
	 * 
	 * As there are some pills are overweight, thus the number of overweight pills is 
	 * num = (weight - 210)/0.1, where the weight is the actual weight.
	 * 
	 * So the number of bottle with overweight pills is  num.
