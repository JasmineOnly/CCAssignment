	 * Observe the chess board, we can find that each white square is surrounded by black squares. 
	 * And each black square is surrounded by white squares. 
	 * 
	 * As a single domino can cover exactly two squares, which indicates that each domino will cover 
	 * one white square and one black square.
	 * 
	 * According to the problem, there are two black squares cut off. 
	 * Thus there are 30 black squares and 32 white squares left, 
	 * which means we can only cover 30*2 squares at most.
	 * 
	 * In a conclusion, we can not use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board.
