	 * We can find the difference between capacities of those two jugs is 2 quart,
	 * that means we can obtain 2 quart water. How can we do that?
	 * 
	 * We can fill 5-quart jug and dump 3 quart water into 3-quart jug, 
	 * now there is 2 quarts of water left in  5-quart jug.
	 * 
	 * We dump all the water in 3-quart jug and dump the water left in 5-quart jug
	 * Now there is no water in 5-quart jug and 2 quarts water in 3-quart jug
	 * 
	 * Now what we need to do is filling the 5-quart jug again. 
	 * Then we dump the water to 3-quart jug until it fills.
	 * 
	 * As there are 2 quarts water in 3-quart jug, we can only dump 1 quart out from 5-quart jug
	 * 
	 * Now we get exactly 4 quarts water in the 5 quart jug
